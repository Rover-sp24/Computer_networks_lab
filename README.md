Computer Networks Lab – Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

Welcome to the repository for the **Computer Networks** laboratory assignments. These hands-on exercises utilize **Cisco Packet Tracer** to illustrate and reinforce the core principles of network design, configuration, and simulation.

***

Lab Exercises Overview

This collection includes multiple assignments that cover fundamental and advanced topics:

Topology Design Exercises

Exercises in this section focus on building and analyzing a variety of network topologies:
- Peer-to-Peer Topology
- Mesh Topology
- Hybrid Topology
- Ring Topology
- Bus Topology
- Star Topology

For each topology, you will find:
- A Packet Tracer simulation file (`.pkt`)
- Visual snapshots of the configured network
- Brief write-ups with important insights and outcomes

***

Software & Tools

- Cisco Packet Tracer – core network simulation and visualization
- GitHub – version control and project submission

***

How to Access the Files

- Explore the `screenshots` directory for visual references of each network build.
- Open associated `.pkt` files directly in Cisco Packet Tracer to review and experiment with live simulations.

***

Learning Objectives

These labs are designed to:
- Deepen understanding of key networking concepts and topologies
- Provide practical experience with configuration and simulation
- Bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world application
